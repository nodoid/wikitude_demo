# wikitude_demo

This is essentially a Xam.Forms wrapper around the standard demo provided with the Wikitude AR component from the Component store. 
Nothing amazing about this demo. Demo 2, that's a different matter, but you'll need to wait for my MVVM Light book for that...

Code is so silly, that the licence has to reflect that. For this reason, I will be releasing this under the Lesser Modified General Purpose DILLIGAF 2 licence. Beer is involved and required if you use any of this code, in any order, for any reason other than wallpapering.
